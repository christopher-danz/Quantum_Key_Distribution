# Quantum_Key_Distribution

### This jupyter notebook was created during 8th week of Qubit by Qubits course on Quantum Computing where we talked about quantum protocols and showcases this very important concept of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), especially the BB84 protocol.

QKD is a fundamental concept of quantum communication. If you want to learn more about QKD, check out Qiskits Textbook: https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html
